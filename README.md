## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

For this project, I used the overflow-x property to avoid having additional issues with the mobile view, where there was ussually an issue with additional scrolling at the bottom of the screen.


```css
body {
  overflow-x: hidden;
}
```


### Continued development

For future projects, I'd like to focus more on utility classes, which I find very useful in avoiding repetitive code and saving time.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRaL-8qZ0mM&t=2423s) - This video will help you understand utility classes and how to build your design system. I would recommend it to anyone who is still learning about this concept.
